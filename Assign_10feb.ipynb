    "Answere :- In Python, the built-in function open() is used to open a file. It takes two arguments - the filename (along with the path, if required) and the mode in which the file is to be opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes of opening a file are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"r\" (Read mode): This mode opens a file for reading only. It is the default mode in which a file is opened. If the file is not found, a FileNotFoundError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"w\" (Write mode): This mode opens a file for writing only. If the file exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" (Append mode): This mode opens a file for writing, but the file pointer is placed at the end of the file. If the file exists, new data is written at the end of the existing data. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x\" (Exclusive creation mode): This mode opens a file for exclusive creation, which means that it will fail if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"b\" (Binary mode): This mode is used when working with binary files like images, videos, etc. It specifies that the file should be opened in binary mode instead of text mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"t\" (Text mode): This mode is used when working with text files. It specifies that the file should be opened in text mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"+\" (Update mode): This mode is used for both reading and writing. It opens a file for updating (reading and writing)."

    "Answere :- In Python, the close() function is used to close an open file object. It is important to close a file because it releases the resources (such as memory and operating system handles) that were allocated to the file when it was opened. Failing to close a file can result in a number of issues, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource leaks: If a program opens many files without closing them, it can exhaust the available system resources, leading to performance problems or even crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data corruption: If a program writes data to a file and does not close it properly, the data may not be written correctly or may be lost altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security vulnerabilities: If a file is not closed properly, it may be accessible to other processes or users, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calling 'close()' on a file object, you ensure that any changes made to the file are saved, and that the resources allocated to the file are freed up. In Python, you can also use the 'with' statement to open a file and ensure that it is closed automatically when the block of code is finished executing, which can help prevent errors caused by failing to close a file."

    "In this example, the 'open()' function is used to open the file 'example.txt' in read mode ('r'). The with statement ensures that the file is closed after the block of code inside it is executed. The file data is read using the read() method and stored in the variable data. Finally, the data is printed to the console.\n",
    "Overall, using the 'with' statement with the 'open()' function provides a safer and more efficient way to read or write data to files, as it takes care of closing the file automatically and reduces the risk of errors or data loss."

    "'write()' function: It is used to write a single string to a file. If the file does not exist, it will be created. If it already exists, the new data will be appended to the end of the file. The syntax of the write() function is:\n",

Then we open the file \"example.txt\" in write mode ('\"w\"') and use the 'writelines()' function to write the list of strings to the file. Finally, we close the file using the close() function. Note that we have added a newline character ('\"\\n\"') at the end of each string in the list, as 'writelines()' does not add any newline character by default."
